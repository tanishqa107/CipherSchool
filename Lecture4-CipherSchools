HTML Tags
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is also the standard markup language for creating web pages
HTML is not case sensitive
it basically tells us the structure of the web page
We start the HTML code by writing <!DOCTYPE html> and then open and close with <html> </html>
we can enclose the title of the page in <head> </head>
then to write the body we start and close by <body> </body>
<h1> </h1> for heading
<p> </p> for paragraph
we can simply take the general code by typing ! and pressing enter in the vs code
the <!DOCTYPE html> means the document is a html document
the <html lang="en"> refers to html tag which is root of any html tag
the <head> tag contains meta data about any web page
<title> specifies the title of the entire web page stored in the menu bar of the web page
there are 6 heading tags from h1 to h6 in which h1 being the largest anf most important one and h6 being the smallest and the least important one
for adding links to the web page we use <a href="link"> </a> tag
for adding image we use <img src="link to image"/> tag we can also use alt="image info" in this section
it will be like <img src="link to image" alt="info image"/>
for adding image present on our system we have to give the absolute path in the link section
<button> title of button </button> will create the button 
<blockquote> </blockquote> or <q> </q> is used for adding quotations to our web page (<q> </q> is a shorter quotation which gives us quotation is double quotes)
for adding abbreviations we use the <abbr> tag
<p><abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>is good</p>
<br> is used for breaking into new line
<address> hi my name is ---- <br> visit me in --- <br> </address> is a address tag
There are 2 list tags present in HTML generally Unordered List and Ordered List
Unordered list lists the elements which does not require any order such as bullets 
while ordered list lists the elemnts in some order such as 1 2 3
for creating unordered list:
<h4> unorderd list </h4>
<ul>
<li>first</li>
<li>second<li>
</ul>
for creating ordered list, we just replace <ul> by <ol>
<dl> </dl> is used for desciption list to provide description for some list
<h2>description list:</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>first</dt>
        <dd>--this is first element</dd>
        <dt>second</dt>
        <dd>--this is second element</dd>        
    </dl>
<hr /> tag is used for inserting horizontal line
<b> </b> is used for bold
<i> </i> is used for italics
<u> </u> is used for underline
div element is often used as a container, it does not have any required own attributes, it is betetr to seperate your code into seperate divs
span element is an inline container which is used to markup a part of a text or a document, it also does not have any own required attributes, it only have style, class and id
<p>this is <span style="color: red">india</span></p>
